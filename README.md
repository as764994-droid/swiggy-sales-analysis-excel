## 🚀 Key Insights & Quantifiable Results
This analysis utilized Time-Series, Geographical, and Categorical segmentation to deliver the following actionable insights:

| Insight | Result & Quantification | Strategic Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seasonal Risk** | Identified a **32% decline in sales** during Q3 (Jul-Sep), primarily driven by underperformance in the **Karnataka** and **Maharashtra** markets. | Immediate need for targeted promotions to stabilize revenue during Q3. |
| **Category Dominance** | **Vegetarian dishes account for 65% of total revenue**, highlighting a strong competitive advantage in the Veg segment. | Directs marketing and investment towards high-margin Veg vendors, especially on high-volume days. |
| **AOV & Rating** | Defined core performance with an **Avg. Order Value (AOV) of ₹268.51** and a strong **Avg. Rating of 4.34**. | Provides a stable benchmark for all future promotional performance and quality checks. |
| **Market Success** | Confirmed **Bengaluru** as the top city, but highlighted **Lucknow** (Rank #2) as a highly successful Tier-2 market, suggesting a repeatable operational model. | Model replication opportunity for expansion into other Tier-2 cities. |
